# Shopify front-end challenge

Hey!
I found and started the application process and this challenge a little late ( on 05/20/2022 ) and i certainly wanted to submit this as quick as possible while also challenging myself a bit.

You'll find the client side facing code is all in plain DOM js, html and css. I decided it would be fun to not rely on something like react or bootstrap.

Server side code however does use a minimal amount of express to keep my api key secret, if i weren't pressed for time i could probably lifted the server up in straight low level node which would've been interesting.

The application should have the link to the client site, but if not and you find yourself here the link is [here](https://ramos159.github.io/shopify-challenge/).

Hope to hear back soon!
